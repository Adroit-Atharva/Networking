Linux
process - system

our system - a collection of at least 3 Linux processes

1 process - ear
1 process - mouth
1 process - brain


ear, mouth - urecv, usend

fork-exec ritual

create an instance of our system


create two instances of our system, say, q1, q2

socket

port - 1234

q1 - port1
q2 - port2
----------

q1 - reverse the string

ear - as far as comm with other systems is concerned it 
      shall be able to receive a message of certain size

mouth - as far as comm with other systems is concerned it 
      shall be able to send a message of certain size

brain - memory, cpu
        primary memory, secondary memory
	b-e file size
	b-m file size

userio - communication between userio and brain 
         shall be using a file
	 b-u file size

id of the system

msg 

id is any arbitrary string of finite length
such that no two systems shall have the same id

each system shall have its own id
and a list of tuples
[<id, [<port,msgsize>]>]

b0 = 0 -> ui is writing
b0 = 1 -> ui has finished writing
b0 = 2 -> br has finished reading

fread is a blocking system call

----------------

um and sm

user wants um to be sent from y1 to y2
then
the system instance at y1 should send um to y2, in finite 
amount of time

um is divided into sm sized chunks 

some sm may not reach y2
algorithm

y1 all sm are sent 

y2/y1 sm0 sm1 sm2 ... smk
      0   1   2       k
y2/y2 sm0 sm0 sm0 sm1 sm0 sm2 sm1 ... smk
      sm0 sm1 sm2 sm3 sm4 ....smk'

utoob

system y1 is online/offline

y is started at t1

y' is started at t2
t2-t1 is finite
after t3>t2 all systems must be able to communicate 
with any other system and t3-t2 is finite

send a message to all systems in the config

sj is a subset of su

tj >= t1

yj with cj containing sj starts at tj
for each system instance y in sj
  yj sends sj to y [which algo???]
for each msg mk received from yk
  yj will do sj' <- sj U sk
  for each system instance y in sj'-sj
     yj will send sj' to y != yk, if needed [justfy ???]
     yj will send sj to yk, if needed
if sj' = sj then terminate the algo else continue

given that t2 > tj for all j is the algo correct?

happy bday
um-id
s - um0-id sm0 sm1 sm2 ... smn
after recving ack for um0-id from r s shall send all sm[i]
and wait for msg from r w.r.t. um0-id
if the alarm goes off for um0-id
  then s shall send an atomic msg w.r.t. um0-id to r
    and wait
    and repeat until 
s receives a msg w.r.t um0-id from r [???]

s shall find out which chunks r has not recved yet

=====
r - recvd chunks and missed chunks

r shall receive um0-id and shall set up a suitable ds
r must send a set of missing sm's w.r.t. um0-id using 
the baby-step1 algo recursively [???]
this msg um-id' is derived from um-id
um-id' is smaller than um-id ???
what is the size of um-id       = size(sm) x n
what will be the size of um-id' = size(num) x n

- - - - - - - um id from s id
0 1 2       n

baby-step0 k resends are needed
so for n chunks nk resends may be needed

baby-step1 at the r the chance of a given chunk is not
  received is (1-p = q)
so pk resends are not necessary but will be carried in
 the baby-step0
 so the rough cost saving shall be around (npk - x)
